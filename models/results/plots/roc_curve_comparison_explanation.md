# ROC Curve Approaches Comparison

## 3-Point ROC Curve (Original)
- **Points**: Only 3 points: (0,0), (FPR, TPR), (1,1)
- **Data Source**: Pre-computed confusion matrix
- **Pros**: Fast, works with summary statistics only
- **Cons**: Doesn't show threshold sensitivity, oversimplified

## Multi-Point ROC Curve (Improved)  
- **Points**: 100+ points across all possible thresholds
- **Data Source**: Raw model predictions on test data
- **Pros**: Shows complete performance trade-offs, standard approach
- **Cons**: Requires access to trained models and test data

## Key Differences

### Smoothness
- 3-point: Angular, straight lines between points
- Multi-point: Smooth curve showing gradual threshold changes

### Information Content
- 3-point: Shows only final operating point performance
- Multi-point: Shows performance at ALL possible decision thresholds

### Clinical/Business Usage
- 3-point: Good for comparing final model selections
- Multi-point: Essential for choosing optimal threshold for deployment

### Mathematical Accuracy
- 3-point: AUC approximation (can be inaccurate)
- Multi-point: Exact AUC calculation using trapezoidal integration
