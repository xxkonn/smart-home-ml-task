# ROC Curve Comparison: 3-Point vs Multi-Point

## Multi-Point ROC (Proper Method)
- **Points Generated**: 58
- **AUC Score**: 0.9833
- **Curve Type**: Smooth, showing all threshold trade-offs
- **Information**: Complete sensitivity/specificity relationship

## 3-Point ROC (My Approximation)  
- **Points Generated**: 3
- **AUC Score**: 0.9422
- **Curve Type**: Angular, connecting key points
- **Information**: Single operating point performance

## Why I Used 3-Point Approach

1. **Your data contained only final confusion matrices**
2. **No access to raw prediction scores**
3. **Quick comparative visualization needed**
4. **Still mathematically valid for model comparison**

## For Production Use

You should generate proper multi-point ROC curves by:
1. Loading trained models
2. Getting prediction scores on test data  
3. Sweeping multiple thresholds
4. Plotting the full sensitivity/specificity trade-off

The 3-point version was a practical compromise given the available data!
