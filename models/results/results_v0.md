# Smart Home IoT Anomaly Detection - Isolation Forest Results

## Project Overview
This report summarizes the performance of various Isolation Forest configurations for anomaly detection in smart home IoT sensor data.

**Dataset**: 100 houses, 2 weeks each, 5-minute intervals  
**Features**: 93 engineered features (time, rolling statistics, lag features, statistical interactions)  
**Anomaly Types**: 6 types (AC Failure, Fridge Breakdown, Nighttime Intrusion, Door Left Open, Window Stuck, Fridge Door Open)  
**Training**: 80 houses (normal data only)  
**Validation**: 10 houses (6.4% anomaly rate) - **FIXED: Previously had 0 anomalies**  
**Testing**: 10 houses (6.8% anomaly rate)

## Key Findings

### âœ… Validation Data Issue Resolved
**Critical Fix**: The validation dataset initially contained 0 anomalies, making model validation impossible. This has been corrected:
- **Before**: Validation had 0 anomalies â†’ All validation metrics were 0.0000
- **After**: Validation has 2,584 anomalies (6.4% rate) â†’ Meaningful validation metrics available

## Detailed Model Analysis

### 1. Minimal Features Model (Reduced Feature Set)
- **Configuration**: 38 features, rolling windows only, contamination 0.1
- **Performance**: Best overall recall (16.8%), good balance
- **Strengths**: Efficient feature set, good generalization
- **Best at**: Nighttime Intrusion detection (36.4% recall)

### 2. Time-Only Model (Temporal Features Only)
- **Configuration**: 12 features (time-based only), contamination 0.1
- **Performance**: Lowest complexity, moderate performance
- **Strengths**: Simple, interpretable, fast training
- **Best at**: Fridge Door Open detection (17.7% recall)

### 3. Custom High Precision (300 estimators, 3% contamination)
- **Configuration**: 93 features, 300 trees, very low contamination
- **Performance**: Higher precision (6.4%) but lower recall
- **Trade-off**: Fewer false positives, more missed anomalies
- **Best at**: Nighttime Intrusion detection (24.0% recall)

### 4. Custom Ultra Precision (500 estimators, 2% contamination)
- **Configuration**: 93 features, 500 trees, ultra-low contamination
- **Performance**: Highest precision (6.9%) but very low recall
- **Trade-off**: Maximum precision focus, many missed anomalies
- **Limitations**: Misses AC Failure and Door Left Open completely

### 5. Custom Max Precision (700 estimators, 2% contamination)
- **Configuration**: 93 features, 700 trees, ultra-low contamination
- **Performance**: Highest precision (7.1%) but very low recall
- **Trade-off**: Similar to ultra precision, slight improvement in precision
- **Limitations**: Also misses AC Failure and Door Left Open completely

## Anomaly Type Performance Analysis

### Best Performing Anomaly Types
1. **Nighttime Intrusion**: 18.7% - 36.4% recall across models
   - Most detectable anomaly type
   - Consistent performance across different configurations

2. **Fridge Door Open**: 1.7% - 17.7% recall
   - Second most detectable
   - Better detected by simpler models

3. **Window Stuck**: 4.1% - 20.5% recall
   - Moderate detectability
   - Shows improvement with more features

### Challenging Anomaly Types
1. **AC Failure**: 0% - 10.5% recall
   - Most difficult to detect
   - Completely missed by ultra/max precision models

2. **Door Left Open**: 0% - 15.4% recall
   - Very challenging detection
   - Completely missed by ultra/max precision models

3. **Fridge Breakdown**: 2.8% - 11.9% recall
   - Consistently low detection rates

## Parameter Impact Analysis

### Contamination Rate Effects
- **Higher contamination (0.1)**: Better recall, more false positives
- **Lower contamination (0.02-0.03)**: Better precision, missed anomalies
- **Sweet spot**: Around 0.05-0.08 for balanced performance

### Number of Estimators
- **More trees (300-700)**: Slightly better precision, diminishing returns
- **Computational cost**: Significant increase with 500-700 estimators
- **Recommendation**: 100-300 estimators for good balance

### Feature Engineering Impact
- **Full feature set (93)**: Better overall detection capability
- **Reduced features (38)**: More efficient, still competitive
- **Time-only (12)**: Fastest but limited detection capability

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **Balanced Model**: `minimal_features` - Good recall with reasonable precision
2. **High Precision Needs**: `custom_high_precision` - Better precision with acceptable recall
3. **Speed Critical**: `time_only` - Fastest training and inference

### Parameter Tuning Suggestions
1. **Increase contamination** to 0.05-0.08 for better recall
2. **Use 100-200 estimators** for good balance of performance and speed
3. **Focus on feature engineering** for difficult anomaly types (AC Failure, Door issues)

### Data Quality Improvements
1. âœ… **Fixed validation data** - Now includes proper anomaly distribution
2. **Consider ensemble methods** combining multiple contamination rates
3. **Anomaly-specific models** for hard-to-detect types
