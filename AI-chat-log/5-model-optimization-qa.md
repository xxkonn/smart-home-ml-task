# Complete Model Optimization Q&A Session - October 1, 2025

## Q: Change setting such as bootstrap is true and enable warm-start, try to train estimators 500 --max-samples 0.6 --contamination 0.02 --max-features 0.8 --warm-start

**A:** I'll modify the Isolation Forest training script to enable bootstrap sampling and warm-start, then train a model with your specified parameters.

*[Modified train_isolation_forest.py to update default parameters]*

Updated the default model parameters in `train_isolation_forest.py`:
- Set `bootstrap=True` (enables sampling with replacement)
- Set `warm_start=True` (reuses previous solutions for efficiency)
- Updated default `max_samples` from 0.6 to match your preference
- Updated default `contamination` to 0.02
- Updated default `max_features` to 0.8

*[Trained the model with specified parameters]*

```bash
cd /mnt/d/smart-home-ml-task && python src/train_isolation_forest.py --n-estimators 500 --max-samples 0.6 --contamination 0.02 --max-features 0.8 --model-name bootstrap_warmstart_500
```

**Training Results:**
```
📊 VALIDATION RESULTS:
   Precision: 0.6461
   Recall: 0.9721
   F1-Score: 0.7755
   Total Samples: 40,320
   False Positives: 1375

🎯 TEST RESULTS:
   Precision: 0.6398
   Recall: 0.9854
   F1-Score: 0.7740
   Total Samples: 40,320
   Anomalies Detected: 2692/2732

🔍 ANOMALY TYPE RECALL (TEST SET):
   AC Failure: 0.9981 (515 samples)
   Fridge Breakdown: 1.0000 (800 samples)
   Nighttime Intrusion: 0.9708 (445 samples)
   Door Left Open: 0.9565 (299 samples)
   Window Stuck: 0.9701 (435 samples)
   Fridge Door Open: 1.0000 (238 samples)
```

The model has been successfully trained with bootstrap=True and warm-start=True! The performance shows excellent recall (98.54%) with good precision (63.98%). The warm-start and bootstrap features are now enabled, which should improve training stability and potentially model performance through better sampling.

## Q: remove the feature scaling when training Isolation Forest

**A:** You're absolutely right! Feature scaling can actually hurt the performance of tree-based algorithms like Isolation Forest. Trees work better with the original feature distributions and ranges. Let me remove the feature scaling from the training process.

*[Modified train_isolation_forest.py to remove StandardScaler]*

I've removed all feature scaling from the Isolation Forest training:

**Key Changes:**
1. **Removed StandardScaler import and usage** - No more feature normalization
2. **Updated logging messages** - Now explicitly states "No feature scaling applied"
3. **Direct feature usage** - Raw features are fed directly to the model
4. **Consistent evaluation** - Both validation and test evaluation use raw features

**Why this improves Isolation Forest performance:**
- **Tree-based algorithms** work better with original feature distributions
- **Isolation paths** are more meaningful with natural feature scales
- **Anomaly detection** relies on feature value ranges and distributions
- **No information loss** from normalization/standardization

The training pipeline now uses raw, unscaled features which should improve the model's ability to detect anomalies based on natural feature patterns and relationships.

## Q: Clean up old model files and train 3 models: 300, 500, 700 estimators with specific contamination and max_samples settings

**A:** I'll clean up the old model files and train 3 fresh models with optimized parameters.

*[Cleaned up old model files]*

```bash
cd /mnt/d/smart-home-ml-task/models && find . -name "*.joblib" -not -name "*.log" -delete
```

Cleaned up old model files. Now training 3 optimized models:

*[Updated example_training.sh to train only the 3 specific models]*

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Clean up any existing models
echo "Cleaning up old models..."
cd /mnt/d/smart-home-ml-task/models
find . -name "*.joblib" -not -name "*.log" -delete 2>/dev/null || true

echo "Starting optimized model training..."

# Train 3 optimized models
cd /mnt/d/smart-home-ml-task

echo "Training estimators_300..."
python src/train_isolation_forest.py --n-estimators 300 --max-samples 0.7 --contamination 0.03 --max-features 0.8 --model-name estimators_300

echo "Training estimators_500..."  
python src/train_isolation_forest.py --n-estimators 500 --max-samples 0.9 --contamination 0.02 --max-features 0.8 --model-name estimators_500

echo "Training estimators_700..."
python src/train_isolation_forest.py --n-estimators 700 --max-samples 0.9 --contamination 0.02 --max-features 0.8 --model-name estimators_700

echo "Training completed!"
```
