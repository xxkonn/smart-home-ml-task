# AI Chat Log: Data Generation

## Q1: Virtual Environment Setup
**User**: I wish all script can be running in venv in this project and add gitignore for keep venv not uploaded.

**Assistant**: I'll help you set up a virtual environment for this project and create a `.gitignore` file to exclude it from version control.

**Actions Completed**:
1. ✅ Created Python virtual environment (`venv/`) with Python 3.10.12
2. ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` with virtual environment exclusions
3. ✅ Created `requirements.txt` with essential packages for anomaly detection
4. ✅ Verified virtual environment activation and Python executable path

**Key Files Created**:
- `venv/` - Virtual environment directory
- `.gitignore` - Git exclusions including venv, Python cache, data files, etc.
- `requirements.txt` - Project dependencies (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)

## Q2: Data Generation Script Request
**User**: Now follow my readme, give me a generate_data.py to train val and test my model in this project.

**Assistant**: I'll create the `generate_data.py` script based on your README specifications, focusing on the unsupervised model dataset structure.

**Actions Completed**:
1. ✅ Created `generate_data.py` script with proper unsupervised dataset splits
2. ✅ Implemented realistic sensor patterns and all 6 anomaly types
3. ✅ Set up directory structure for unsupervised learning (train/val/test)
4. ✅ Installed required packages and tested data generation

**Dataset Structure Generated**:
- **Training Set**: 80 houses (1-80) with normal data only (no anomalies)
- **Validation Set**: 10 houses (81-90) with normal data only (no anomalies)
- **Test Set**: 10 houses (91-100) with all 6 anomaly types for evaluation

**Key Features Implemented**:
- 100 houses total with 2 weeks of data each
- 5-minute intervals (4,032 data points per house)
- 26,392 total anomaly points across all houses
- Realistic sensor patterns: temperature cycles, motion peaks, door schedules
- All 6 anomaly types: AC failure, fridge breakdown, intrusion, door/window stuck, fridge door open
- Perfect for Isolation Forest training (normal data only in training set)

**File Structure**:
```
data/
├── unsupervised/
│   ├── train/        # 80 houses, normal data only
│   └── val/          # 10 houses, normal data only  
└── test/             # 10 houses, with all anomalies
```

**Script Execution Results**:
```
✅ Dataset Generation Complete!
📊 Generated data for 100 houses
🚨 Total anomaly points: 26,392
📁 Data structure:
   - Training: 80 houses (normal data only)
   - Validation: 10 houses (normal data only)
   - Testing: 10 houses (with anomalies)
📂 Data saved to: /mnt/d/smart-home-ml-task/data
```

## Summary
This session focused on setting up the development environment and generating synthetic smart home IoT datasets for anomaly detection. The key accomplishments include:

1. **Environment Setup**: Virtual environment with proper dependency management
2. **Data Generation**: Comprehensive dataset with realistic patterns and 6 anomaly types
3. **Unsupervised Learning Support**: Training data contains only normal patterns, perfect for Isolation Forest
4. **Project Structure**: Clean organization with proper git exclusions

The generated dataset follows the README specifications exactly and is ready for training anomaly detection models.
